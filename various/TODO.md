## This is TODO list for things that I need to explore

1. [TypeParameters] Using full and correct type parameters when designing API instead of T, K, E etc., i.e. something like TYPE, ELEM, KEY - gist
1. [DI] Make gist with summary of all techniques, also how to use them Play and with Akka
1. [Collections] Learn Scala collection API in depth.
1. [ClassTag] What is the difference between ClassTag, TypeTag and Manifest ?
1. [ClassTag] Is there yet something different like \*Tag ?
1. [ClassTag] Why presentation states that it is w/o 'runtime performance overhead'
1. [ClassTag] Scala reflection - gist
1. [TypeClasses] Look on constraint of context-bounds, more pariculary "possible only when one type-class is used and it requires only one type parameter"?
1. [TypeClasses] How to use type-constructors with type-classes?
1. [TypeClasses] Check-out possible options to encode type-classes? See https://github.com/mpilquist/simulacrum for details
1. [Implicits] How them use in API design - gist
1. [Implicits] Read "Implicits w/o Import Tax"
